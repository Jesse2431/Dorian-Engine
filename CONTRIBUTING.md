# Contributing
Your help is highly valued! Below we discuss a few things that are important to know before contributing.

## Coding style
In this repository we enforce PascalCase. camelCase is used in variables gathered from function arguments. A good example on this may be found below:
```CSharp
namespace DorianEngine.Core
{
    public class Material
    {
        public Vector3 DiffuseColor;
        public float Alpha;
    
        public Material(Vector3 diffuseColor, float alpha)
        {
            DiffuseColor = diffuseColor;
            Alpha = alpha;
        }
    }
}
```

## Way of contributing
We most appreciate contributions directly by forking the repository, making your changes, and then making a pull request.

## Contribution rules
- Comments are not necessary, but preferred if you deem the code difficult to understand to someone else.
- Keep external dependencies/additional libraries to a bare **minimum**.
- Do not make use of the content manager. Everything must be done from stream/from file. No MGCB.

## What to contribute on
Things that need to be worked on, include, but are not limited to:
- Basic physics
	- Rigidbody component
	- Mesh collider component
	- Wheel component
- Editor/Studio
	- Scene tree
	- Properties
	- Solution explorer
	- Lua IDE
	- Scene preview
- Default shader
	- Diffuse
	- Specular
	- Bump mapping
	- Reflections
- Lua scripting
	- Choose external library for Lua
	- Translate C# functions to Lua for scripting
- Audio component
	- Decide if another library or not
	- Volume
	- Speed
	- Paused
	- Looped
	- Hearing range
	- Hearing range fade
- Extended 3D model format
	- FBX? 3DS? DirectX? Needs animation support

Itâ€™s important to note that the topics mentioned are not the only that need to be worked on. Approved feature requests are also things that need to be worked on.
