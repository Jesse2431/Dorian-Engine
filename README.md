# Dorian Engine
Powerful DirectX MonoGame game engine, in the end designed to run on games similar to the Driver/Stuntman series.

# Using the engine
Clone, download zip or whatever you want the code, reference DorianEngine, and then check out `Sandbox` because my fucking time is limited to shit-ass school so I can't explain. Best of luck.

# MGCB
Stfu. We don't use that here.
