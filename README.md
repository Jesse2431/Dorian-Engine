![Dorian Engine logo](logo.png)
A powerful C# DirectX game engine, made with MonoGame. In the end designed to be used for games similar to the Driver/Stuntman series, but due to ECS should be able to do anything.

## Using the engine
Take a look at the `Sandbox` project, and/or refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/Jesse2431/Dorian-Engine/wiki) for manual setup.

## Features
- Fully ECS (Entity-Component-System), no hard-coding involved
- Complete 3D rendering, easily extendable with custom model formats
- Integrated GUI system using MonoGame's `SpriteBatch`
- Handcrafted physics engine, designed for the Dorian Engine

## Contributing
Your contribution is highly valued! Please check [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) for that. It contains a roadmap and contributing rules/guidelines.

## Acknowledgements
- The engine does **not**, and never will, natively (have) support (for making) 2D games. The main effort is focused towards 3D.
- The engine does **not** make use of MGCB content files for game content. Thus any Content Pipeline extensions are rendered unusable.
- The engine has no license. I thus automatically reserve all right to the whole repository code, with exceptions to XNA/MonoGame licensed code. For any serious inqueries, please contact me on Discord at `jesse3869`.
- Everything provided is as-is. I hold no liability over any damages done to your system that could have been made (by your modifications).
