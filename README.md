# Dorian Engine
Powerful DirectX MonoGame game engine. In the end designed to run on games similar to the Driver/Stuntman series, but due to ECS should be able to do anything.

# Using the engine
Right now it's still heavily work in progress, so there isn't much to use yet. Coming soon!

# MGCB "Content" files?
We don't use that here.
