# Dorian Engine
Powerful DirectX MonoGame game engine, in the end designed to run on games similar to the Driver/Stuntman series.

# Using the engine
Clone, download zip or whatever you want the code, reference DorianEngine, and then check out `Sandbox` because my time is limited and I'm not wasting it on explaining it you right now. Best of luck.
